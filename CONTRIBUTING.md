# Contributing Guidelines

## Making a pull request

Please keep the following points in mind while making a pull request:

- For Vala source, follow the [elementary code style](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/writing-apps/code-style). Running [vala-lint](https://github.com/vala-lang/vala-lint) will help you there.
- Keep the pull requests small. For large features, try to break the changes into multiple modular pull requests.
- Add or modify unit tests wherever applicable. These reside in the `tests` directory.
